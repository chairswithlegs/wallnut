# Default Theme Views

The directory contains the out-of-box views used by Wallnut. Views in this directory are overridden by the views in the present the in the active theme. This can be done adding new views to the active theme's view folder, located here: themes/<active theme name>/views

New views should the use the same file name as the view they are intended to override. E.g. post.pug in the active theme will override post.pug in this directory.
